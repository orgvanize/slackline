Slackline: a bot to bridge channels between *free* Slack workspaces
=========

Launch the server:
 1. If persistence is desired (required for production), set up a PostgresSQL database.
 2. To enable persistence so threading, editing, and deletion work after a restart, export variable:
    $ export DATABASE_URL=postgres://<path>
 3. Start the server by executing:
    $ PORT=<port> npm start
 4. Take note of the fully-qualified URL and port at which you are running the server.

For each workspace you want to bridge, do the following:
 1. Navigate to https://api.slack.com/apps and hit Create New App.
 2. Choose an App Name (e.g., Slackline) and select the workspace.
 3. Under Display Information, customize the appearance of the bot user.
 4. Under Features in the sidebar, click Event Subscriptions.
 5. Toggle the Enable Events slider to On.
 6. Enter the URL of your server under Request URL.
 7. Expand Subscribe to bot events and add all of the following:
    message.channels, message.groups, message.im, member_joined_channel, reaction_added
 8. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom.
 9. Under Features in the sidebar, click Slash Commands, then hit Create New Command.
10. Set Command to whatever you prefer (e.g., slackline).
11. Reenter your same server URL in Request URL.
12. Set Short Description to whatever you like and hit Save.
13. Repeat for each desired command abbreviation/alias.
14. Under Features in the sidebar, click OAuth & Permissions.
15. Leave channels:read and groups:read selected and grant all of the following further permissions:
    chat:write.customize (and chat:write), im:read, team:read, users:read, reactions:write
16. Under Features in the sidebar, click App Home.
17. Make sure Messages Tab is enabled, then further customize the bot's appearance, e.g.:
    Display Name (Bot Name), Always Show My Bot as Online
18. Under Settings in the sidebar, click Install App.
19. Click the Install to Workspace button and hit Allow on the confirmation screen.
20. Once back at Installed App settings, copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token to your clipboard.

Configure the server by updating its environment as follows:
 1. For each (zero-indexed) workspace you want to connect to, export an environment variable:
    $ export TOKEN_<index>=<subdomain>#<secret>
 2. For each (uni-directional) channel broadcast bridge, export an environment variable:
    $ export LINE_<workspace>_<channel>=<workspace>#<channel>
 3. For the best tested configuration, configure the opposite direction of each bridge as well.
 4. Restart the server.

For each workspace, give the bot user access to each channel you configured above:
 1. Navigate to https://<subdomain>.slack.com and one of the channels in question.
 2. Press the Show channel details button in the upper-right corner.
 3. In the right-hand sidebar, click More, choose Add apps, and find your newly-created app.
 4. Repeat these steps for each other channel in the workspace.
