Slackline: a bot to bridge channels between *free* Slack workspaces
=========

For each workspace you want to bridge, do the following:
 1. Navigate to https://api.slack.com/apps and hit Create New App.
 2. Choose an App Name (e.g., Slackline) and select the workspace.
 3. Under Display Information, customize the appearance of the bot user.
 4. Under Features in the sidebar, click OAuth & Permissions.
 5. Grant all of the following permissions:
    channels:history, channels:read, chat:write, chat:write.customize, groups:history, groups:read,
    reactions:read, team:read, users:read
 6. Under Settings in the sidebar, click Install App.
 7. Click the Install App button and accept the confirmation screen.
 8. Once back at Installed App settings, copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token to your clipboard.

Now set up the environment under which you will run the server:
 1. Set up a PostgresSQL database server and export the following environment variable:
    $ export DATABASE_URL=postgres://<path>
 2. For each (zero-indexed) workspace you want to connect to, export an environment variable:
    $ export TOKEN_<index>=<subdomain>#<secret>
 3. For each (uni-directional) channel broadcast bridge, export an environment variable:
    $ export LINE_<workspace>_<channel>=<workspace>#<channel>
 4. For the best tested configuration, configure the opposite direction of each bridge as well.
 5. Start the server by executing: $ npm start
 6. Take note of the fully-qualified URL and port at which you are running the server.

Return to the Slack API console and do the following for each of the apps you created earlier:
 1. Under Features in the sidebar, click Event Subscriptions.
 2. Toggle the Enable Events slider to On.
 3. Enter the URL of your server under Request URL.
 4. Expand Subscribe to bot events and add all of the following:
    message.channels, member_joined_channel, message.groups, reaction_added
 5. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom.

For each workspace, give the bot user access to each channel you configured above:
 1. Navigate to https://<subdomain>.slack.com and one of the channels in question.
 2. Press the Show channel details button in the upper-right corner.
 3. In the right-hand sidebar, click More, choose Add apps, and find your newly-created app.
 4. Repeat these steps for each other channel in the workspace.
